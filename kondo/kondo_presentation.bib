abstract={In this work, a multichannel Kondo-lattice model is studied in the thermodynamic limit. The conduction band is described by a constant hopping amplitude between any pair of lattice sites. Because of the infinite range hopping, the dimensionality of the lattice can be arbitrary. For this system, we have obtained the exact thermodynamical properties and the ground-state energies. The metal-insulator transition of the system is discussed at zero temperature in detail, and the phase diagram is provided. Because of the infinite range hopping of the conduction band, the model we solve here is different from the usual situation. In the limit of strong interaction between the conduction electrons and the impurity spins, the wavefunctions take the Jastrow product form, which reflects the strong correlations of the impurity spins and the conduction electrons.},
