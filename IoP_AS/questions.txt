1. What do you mean precisely by ‘confinement–deconfinement’ in this context? → Are holons/doublons gauge-charged objects? What is the confining force?
- bound because decoupling them costs energy U

3. Is your ‘Mott metal’ distinct from a bad metal or incoherent metal?
- bad metals are defined usualy in terms of temperature; our Mott metal is defined at T=0, in terms of \Sigma \sim w^{-2}

4. Which experimental observable would unambiguously distinguish your pseudogap-Mott metal from other pseudogap scenarios?
- divergent scattering rate

5. Why should an impurity fixed point control a 2D lattice problem?
- phases are mostly-governed by local repulsion

6. What are the limitations of the tiling procedure?
- biased towards local correlations, difficult to track long-range models

7. How does this differ from cluster DMFT or DCA?
- spatial correlations are better captured. less intensive, more k-space resolution possible

8. What symmetries are restored and which are not after tiling?
- all symmetries

9. Why is the weak interaction W on bath sites essential?
- no transition otherwise

10. What fixes the sign of W? Is it physical or phenomenological?
- phenomenological

11. Does your phase diagram survive if W = 0?
- No phase transition for W=0.

12. Is the Kondo coupling momentum-dependent by construction or emergent?
- by construction, through the lattice geometry

13. Is the Kondo breakdown driven primarily by charge or spin fluctuations?
- charge fluctuations primarily. the charge fluctuations kill Kondo screening

15. How does URG compare to Wilsonian RG or functional RG?
- the URG incorporates the effect of interaction through a non-trivial denominator, and allows relevant finite-coupling fixed points

16. What is the controlled small parameter?
- overlap of impurity wavefunctions

17. Are the flow equations exact or truncated?
- exact in diagonal interaction

19. Can URG access finite-temperature properties reliably?
- We are working on it.

20. What exactly breaks down at the Kondo breakdown point?
- Kondo screening, Landau quasiparticles

21. Is there a sharp order parameter for the pseudogap?
- holon-doublon excitations, Greens function for them

22. Is the pseudogap phase stable or just a crossover?

23. How do you define a Luttinger surface in an interacting system?
- zeros of the one-particle Greens functions

24. Is the zero of the Green’s function protected?
- the topological Lifshitz transition of the Fermi surface and the appearance of a 2CK model in the PG should protect the zeros.

25. Are the arcs real Fermi surfaces or finite-lifetime remnants?
- real Fermi surfaces

26. Does Luttinger’s theorem hold in your pseudogap phase?
- yes, due to particle-hole symmetry

30. Why is quantum Fisher information the right diagnostic here?
- can track multipartite entanglement

31. Is multipartite entanglement really a phase diagnostic or just a crossover indicator?
- it appears to be a phase diagnostic, because it remains large invariant through the phase

32. Can your entanglement signatures be measured experimentally?
- The QFI can be be expressed in terms of Kubo correlations functions. VNE can probably be measured indirectly from static correlation function measurements

34. Why does the HK model emerge as the effective theory?
- the nodal metal hosts singular interactions in momentum space, leading to long-ranged correlations in real-space. This naturally leads to the HK model, which is also long-ranged in real space.

36. Is this critical point stable in 2D, or only at fine tuning?
- will need to check this. the simplicity of the model and the theories suggest it may be stable

37. How does this compare to a conventional Mott QCP in DMFT?
- long-range multipartite entanglement, Sigma_imag ~ omega^{-2}, holon-doublon deconfinement

39. How general is your framework?
- various lattice geometries, doping, multiple bands/layers. Work underway to incorporate finite temperatures
